## Steganography Tool 

A Python-based steganography tool that allows users to hide text or images within images. This project provides a user-friendly interface using `customtkinter` and utilizes `PIL` and `OpenCV` for encoding and decoding hidden data.

### Features 
- **Text in Image:** Hide secret text inside an image and extract it when needed.
- **Image in Image:** Conceal an entire image within another image and retrieve it later.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with `customtkinter` for an intuitive experience.
- **Image Processing:** Uses `OpenCV` and `PIL` for efficient encoding and decoding.
- **Supports PNG, JPEG, JPG Formats.**

### Installation 
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install customtkinter opencv-python numpy pillow
```

### Usage 
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Select whether you want to hide text or an image.
3. Choose an image and input the data to be hidden.
4. Save the steganographed image.
5. Decode whenever required.
